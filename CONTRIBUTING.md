# Contributing to Learned Encoding Experiment

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this research! This project explores a fundamental breakthrough in how neural networks should learn token representations.

## 🎯 Project Vision

We're revolutionizing token embeddings by proving that:
- Signal emerges from token relationships, not individual tokens
- Learning encodings during training beats pre-trained autoencoders
- Massive compression (8:1+) is possible with maintained performance

## 🚀 How to Contribute

### Research Extensions
- **Larger Vocabularies**: Test with 1K, 10K, 50K token vocabularies
- **Real Data**: Wikipedia, code, genomic sequences
- **Architecture Improvements**: Attention mechanisms, proper gradients
- **Compression Limits**: How far can we push the compression ratio?

### Code Improvements
- **Proper Backpropagation**: Replace gradient approximation
- **GPU Support**: CUDA implementations for scaling
- **Visualization**: Training curves, embedding analysis
- **Benchmarking**: Performance comparisons

### Documentation
- **Research Paper**: Academic writeup
- **Tutorials**: How to apply to new domains
- **Examples**: Genomic AI, large language models
- **Theory**: Mathematical foundations

## 🧪 Running Experiments

```bash
# Quick test (no dependencies)
python3 pure_python_experiment.py

# Full experiment (requires numpy/matplotlib)
python3 learned_encoding_experiment.py
```

## 📊 Experiment Ideas

### Easy Contributions
1. **Different compression ratios**: 4:1, 16:1, 32:1
2. **More training epochs**: Test convergence limits
3. **Different activation functions**: Sigmoid, tanh, swish
4. **Regularization**: L1/L2 penalties on encodings

### Advanced Research
1. **Genomic sequences**: Real DNA/protein data
2. **Multi-task learning**: Shared encodings across tasks
3. **Adaptive compression**: Dynamic encoding dimensions
4. **Theoretical analysis**: Why does this work?

## 🔬 Code Style

- **Pure Python first**: Keep dependencies minimal
- **Clear documentation**: Explain the theory
- **Reproducible results**: Set random seeds
- **Performance metrics**: Always measure compression vs quality
