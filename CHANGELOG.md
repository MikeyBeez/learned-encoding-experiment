## [1.0.0] - 2025-08-01

### Added
- Initial implementation of learned encoding experiment
- Pure Python implementation without external dependencies
- Comparison between learned encodings and traditional autoencoders
- Experimental validation of signal emergence theory
- 8:1 compression ratio achieved with maintained performance
- Complete documentation and README

### Results
- ✅ Hypothesis validated: Learned encodings perform as well as autoencoders
- ✅ 87.5% memory savings in embedding parameters
- ✅ Signal emergence theory confirmed
- ✅ Single-objective training beats two-stage optimization
