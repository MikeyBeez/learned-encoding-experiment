## 📐 Compression Scaling Study
This study evaluates the performance of the Learned vs. Traditional (Autoencoder) model across different embedding compression ratios.
| Compression Ratio | Learned PPL | Traditional PPL | Advantage | Statistically Significant? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8.0:1 | 1662.99 | 1623.20 | Traditional (+2.4%) | ❌ No |

### Key Insights
- **No Clear Advantage**: Neither model showed a consistent, statistically significant advantage.
- **Recommendation**: Both models perform similarly. The choice may depend on other factors like training time or implementation complexity.
