# Learned Encoding Experiment

**Testing the Signal Emergence Theory: Can we learn encodings 1/10th the size during training?**

## 🎯 Core Hypothesis

1. **One-hot encodings have identity, not signal** - They just say "I am token #3"
2. **Signal emerges from relationships between multiple tokens** - Meaning comes from context
3. **Learning encodings during training** (not via autoencoders) preserves performance
4. **1/10th size encodings work** if learned properly for the specific task

## 🧪 Experiment Design

### Traditional Approach (Baseline)
```
1. Pre-train autoencoder: tokens → 64D embeddings → 6D compressed → 64D reconstructed
2. Use compressed 6D representations in main model
3. Problem: Optimizes for reconstruction, not downstream task
```

### Learned Approach (Our Innovation)
```
1. Direct token encoder: tokens → 6D representations (learnable during training)
2. Train entire pipeline with next-token prediction
3. Advantage: Optimizes for actual task performance
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Run the full experiment
python learned_encoding_experiment.py

# Or run quick test
python run_test.py
```

## 📊 Expected Results

If the hypothesis is correct, we should see:
- **Learned encodings perform as well as traditional autoencoders**
- **10:1 compression ratio with minimal performance loss**
- **Single-objective training beats two-stage optimization**

## 🔬 Technical Details

### Key Innovation: Learnable Token Encoder
```python
# Traditional approach - separate autoencoder training
autoencoder = train_autoencoder(tokens)  # Optimizes reconstruction
model = train_model(autoencoder.encode(tokens))  # Different objective!

# Our approach - joint learning
model.token_encoder = learnable_matrix(vocab_size, compressed_dim)
train_model(tokens)  # Single objective trains everything!
```

### Architecture Comparison
- **Traditional**: 50 vocab × 64D = 3,200 parameters → compress to 6D
- **Learned**: 50 vocab × 6D = 300 parameters (direct mapping)
- **Compression**: 10.7:1 reduction in embedding parameters

## 💡 Why This Matters

**If successful, this validates:**
1. **Signal emergence theory** - Meaning comes from token relationships
2. **Joint optimization** - Single objective > multi-stage training  
3. **Massive context scaling** - 10x more tokens in same memory
4. **Path to genomic AI** - Full genome processing becomes feasible

## 🧬 Applications

### Genomic Medicine
- **Human genome**: 3.2B base pairs
- **Vocabulary**: Only 8 tokens {A,T,C,G,N,START,END,PAD}
- **Learned encoding**: 8 → 64D still captures biological patterns
- **Result**: Full genome in manageable context window

### Natural Language
- **Current**: 50K vocab × 4096D = 200M embedding parameters
- **Learned**: 50K vocab × 512D = 25M parameters (8:1 compression)
- **Benefit**: Massive memory savings + better task optimization

## 📈 Measurement Criteria

**Success = Learned ≤ Traditional × 1.1** (within 10% performance)

**Metrics:**
- Final loss comparison
- Training convergence speed  
- Memory usage reduction
- Generation quality

## 🎓 Theoretical Foundation

### Why Autoencoders Fail
- **Reconstruction objective** ≠ **generation objective**
- **Information preservation** ≠ **task-relevant information**
- **Two-stage optimization** creates misaligned incentives

### Why Learned Encodings Work  
- **Single objective** aligns compression with task
- **Token relationships** learned during actual usage
- **Gradient flow** optimizes encoding for generation quality

**Hypothesis Validated If:**

## 🔬 Mathematical Foundation

### Signal Emergence Theory
```
Traditional: Token → One-hot → Embedding → Compressed
Problem: One-hot has no semantic signal

Learned: Token → Learned Representation (task-optimized)
Advantage: Encoding learns semantic relationships directly
```

### Optimization Alignment
```
Autoencoder Loss: ||original - reconstructed||²
Generation Loss: -log P(next_token | context)

Problem: Different objectives, misaligned gradients
Solution: Single objective trains compression for generation
```

## 📊 Experiment Parameters

```python
vocab_size = 50              # Manageable for testing

epochs = 30                  # Sufficient for convergence
learning_rate = 0.01         # Optimized for both approaches
```
